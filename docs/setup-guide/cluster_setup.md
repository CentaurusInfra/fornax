## Scenarios & Design Considerations

Edge computing is being adopted in traditional and new industries at a quick pace. Applications for factory automation, automated vehicles, security surveillance,  medical operation, remote monitoring, etc. are enjoying the benefits of shifting workload closer to the fields of operation. In specific, here are  three of the most prominent fields that are seeing the most development with edge adoption: 

- IoT, where devices such as temperature sensors and surveillance cameras are connected to edge nodes.
- Smart Factory, where cluster of nodes run on the edge site.
- Multi-access edge computing (MEC), where edge applications run on edge nodes or clusters placed in or close to the cellular network.

A common theme of these fields is data driven. Data is captured at the user site (the "edge"). Due to the size, security and latency limitation, it's more beneficial to process the data as close to the capturing sites as possible. This is especially needed for mission critical applications such as medical operation that utilizes AI for image segmentation and analysis. Inference needs to be carried out onsite with high reliability and low latency. Here is a summary of the typical edge computing environment features:

- Low computing power
- Low energy supply and consumption
- Unstable network connection
- Smaller or no dev-ops teams
- Complex topology

The goal of Centaurus edge is providing a framework that allows user applications to run reliably in the edge environments. Note that the difference between running applications in local environments and on the edge is that edge can provide the benefits of both the cloud and local computing. Cloud environments provide vast computing power ("unlimited" in illusion) with longer data transmit latency while edge comes in with various computing power and network speeds. For example, AI training is better suited in the cloud while the inference is better on the edge. Edge computing is not equal to "running things in a local data center", but rather to offer a way for different components of applications to run in their best suited environments in collective efforts. 

## Design Principles

### Robustness

Centaurus edge addresses the requirements by allowing workloads on the edge to continue functioning with tolerance to the following conditions: 

1. Network disconnect
2. Edge node failure
3. Both 1. and 2. happen Simultaneously 

Altogether, meeting the three requirements would allow applications to run on the edge with the best effort against environment fluctuation and node failures.

### Flexible Topology

Edge computer resources are usually deployed in 2+ layers, as shown in the following figure. "Edge site" represents a location with a certain amount of compute resources co-exist, in the same network sometimes. "Device" represents data collection devicess such as IoT, cameras, temperature sensors, etc. The number of layers and interconnection topology are usually the aggregated result of various application design considerations such as latency, data locality and safety, network bandwidth, etc. On edge sites closer to the user, there's usually less computing power, but data takes less time to transit, whereas at higher layers, more computing power (and electricity capacity for cooling too) is available, but data takes longer to arrive. In between these, there's myriad of possible configurations. Noting such layered feature, Centaurus edge is designed to allow hierarchical construction of edge cluster topology for flexible configurability.

## Existing Solutions

### IoT

These solutions provide functions to manage computing nodes running on the edge environments. The control plane sits in the cloud, and an "agent" type of software component is deployed on the edge node to allow edge nodes to continue running when the network disconnects. Examples of such solutions include:

- [KubeEdge](https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge)
- [OpenYurt](https://github.com/openyurtio/openyurt)
- [SuperEdge](https://github.com/superedge/superedge)
- [BAETYL](https://github.com/baetyl/baetyl)
- [Virtual Kubelet](https://virtual-kubelet.io/)

These solutions meet condition 1 of the design principles.  

### Edge Cluster 

These solutions run full clusters on the edge with the control plane such as apiserver, controllers and scheduler. Examples of such solutions include:

- [Kubefed](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubefed)
- [Karmada](https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada)
- [TKEStack](https://github.com/tkestack/tke)
- [Cluster-registry](https://github.com/kubernetes-retired/cluster-registry), retired
- [Namespace Sameness](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-multicluster/namespace-sameness-position-statement.md)

These solutions meet condition 2 of the design principles.

## Models

The Centaurus Edge architecture is modeled as an [m-ary tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-ary_tree) where an [Arktos](https://github.com/CentaurusInfra/arktos) control plane sits at the root of the tree in the cloud, and leaf tree nodes represent computing nodes on the edge. The sub-trees in the m-ary tree are standalone clusters, and the roots of the sub-trees are control planes for edge clusters. As usual with Arktos clusters, there are also compute nodes in the cloud managed by the root level Arktos control plane.

The following graph is an example of such an edge model.

<img src="images/centaurus-edge-model.png"
     width="50%"
     align="center"/>

The m-ary tree model satisfies all four previously mentioned requirements. Each edge node is deployed with an "edge agent" component that maintains connection with the control plane, runs Arktos workload, and cache messages from and to the control plane. It's worth noting that the "control plane" here is not necessarily the Arktos in the cloud. It refers to the control plane which the current node connects to. 

When the network disconnects, the workload continues running (condition 1). When a worker node in the edge cluster dies, its workloads could be migrated to other nodes in the same cluster (condition 2). And because the control plane operates locally with the worker nodes, condition 3 can also be achieved. 

Being a tree structure, the layered and hierarchy nature of edge site topology can be expressed with great flexibility. Depending on use cases, edge environments could have vastly different requirements and restrictions. The design of Centaurus edge strives to leave the choice to users by offering a flexible framework. As an example, The following graph shows two possible modes that edge clusters can be structured. Each triangle represents a cluster. Mode 1 is a "flat" structure where each edge cluster directly connects to the cloud control plane. This structure, similar to federation, could benefit the case where clusters are managed centrally from the cloud, and each cluster has network connectivity to the cloud via public internet. In comparison, in mode 2, edge clusters are locally connected in a hierarchy, and only certain edge clusters are connected to the cloud. This mode maps more closely to scenarios where multiple edge clusters are managed from within an on-prem network boundary. Local management is available even when connection to the cloud is lost whereas in mode 1, user control relies on internet connection being accessible between the cloud and edge clusters.  

<img src="images/layered-vs-flat.png"
     width="70%" 
     align="center"/>

Mode 1 and 2 are two extremes of the Centaurus edge model expressibility. In between are various possibilities of combination, and the choice is in the hands of users. This kind of flexibility allows edge clusters to be structured to match as close as possible to the physical or logical model of edge application.

## Key Feature Design

This section details the design of key components to implement the Centaurus edge model.

### Edge Cluster
Centaurus edge supports a variety of "K8s" flavors running as edge clusters. This includes "vanilla" K8s, [k3s](https://k3s.io/), and Arktos. The following figure details the components of an edge cluster. 

<img src="images/edge-cluster-components.png"
     width="50%" 
     align="center"/>

From an edge cluster's own perspective, it operates as usual by watching its etcd and managing its workload. It's not aware of itself being anything different than a K8s cluster running in the cloud.

From Centaurus's perspective, all edge nodes and clusters are connected in a cascading (or layered, hierarchical) structure with the help of the following components.

### Robust Edge Clusters
Derived from KubeEdge's Cloud Core and Cloud Edge concepts, an "Edge Agent" is installed on each edge node. This edge agent is responsible for managing communication with the upper level control plane, caching information in a local database (e.g. SQLite), and distributing messages to lower level entities on the same node. In addition to the Edged found in KubeEdge, a new controller called EdgeClusterd is introduced. While Edged relays and manages workloads on the edge node. The edge agent is what's providing robustness to edge workloads against network disconnect. The connection between Edge Hub and Cloud Hub is still implemented using WebSocket. Watch is not used because network fluctuation could cause frequent List operations which could consume large network capacity. Optionally, edge clusters could watch upper clusters if the network is reliable between them.

### Cascaded Edge Clusters 
With Cloud Core and Edge Agent as the connect mechanism, an edge cluster can be connected into a higher level cluster. To express such relationshio in K8s, a new object called EdgeCluster is introduced:

```golang
type EdgeCluster struct {
	metav1.TypeMeta `json:",inline"`
	// +optional
	metav1.ObjectMeta `json:"metadata,omitempty"`
	// Spec defines desired state of network
	// +optional
	Spec EdgeClusterSpec `json:"spec"`
	State EdgeClusterState `json:"state,omitempty"`
} 
```

The EdgeCluster object is similar to the Node object in terms of the level of abstraction. An EdgeCluster object is created for each edge cluster. This new abstraction allows the expression of a group of edge clusters connected in a tree structure. Each edge cluster, just like a regular K8s cluster, maintains its pool of nodes. Furthermore, it also maintains an array of subordinate clusters that connect to it. The state of each subordinate edge clusters are stored in the EdgeClusterState struct:

```golang
type EdgeClusterState struct {
	EdgeClusters map[string]string `json:"edgeclusters,omitempty"`	// subordinate clusters and their states
	HealthStatus string `json:"healthstatus,omitempty"`
	Nodes []string `json:"nodes,omitempty"`
	EdgeNodes []string `json:"edgenodes,omitempty"`
	ReceivedMissions []string `json:"receivedmissions,omitempty"`
	ActiveMissions []string `json:"activemissions,omitempty"`
	LastHeartBeat metav1.Time `json:"lastheartbeat,omitempty"`
}
```

The Cloud Core and Edge Agent bind two clusters together. In KubeEdge, Cloud Core is only deployed on the edge as the name suggests. However, it can be extended for cascading clusters on the edge too, as shown in the following figure:

<img src="images/cascaded-cluster.png"
     width="60%" 
     align="center"/>

In the control plane of an edge cluster, the Cloud Core component is activated to connect to its own subordinate edge nodes and edge clusters, and the EdgeCluster objects are also created in this edge clusters to represent those subordinate edge clusters.  

### Supporting Multiple K8s Flavors
Edge clusters can be running different flavors of K8s. For the EdgeClusterd to be able to communicate with a variety of K8s cluster control planes, KubeClient compatibility has to be resolved. For example, the KubeClient in Arktos has been extended to carry tenant information. Using this to watch a vanilla K8s apiserver will cause errors. Same vice versa. As a quick solution, the commandline kubectl binary can be used instead. This kubectl is provided by the subordinate cluster and therefore guarantees compatibility. More comprehensive solution would involve modifying KubeClient and this will be further investigated in later release cycles. 

### Workload Assignment
With a single edge node, workload usually refers to a single pod and virtual machine if it's supported. For a cluster, it is extended to objects such as deployment, job, statefulset, etc. In the Centaurus edge clusters, "workload" is used to refer to both cases. Because of the hierarchical nature of edge structure, workloads need to navigate to the destined nodes or clusters by traversing the tree structure, and this is called workload assignment. 

There are two implementation options for workload assignment. The first option is "invasive" to existing K8s implementation. It uses labels inside workload objects to specify the rules for targeted destinations. This method uses standard K8s object definitions, and therefore allows existing workload specifications (e.g. a yaml file for a deployment) to be used. However, controllers for the supported object types need to be changed accordingly.

The second option is less "invasive" by packing the workload object inside another object implemented by CRD. No changes are needed for existing controllers. The CRD is handled by a controller which receives, propagates, and delivers to the destined clusters. This method, however, requires creating new CRD definitions from existing workload specifications, although this could potentially be automated with the least user intervention. The following is an example of this option:

```golang
type Mission struct {
	metav1.TypeMeta `json:",inline"`
	// +optional
	metav1.ObjectMeta `json:"metadata,omitempty"`
	Spec MissionSpec `json:"spec"`
	State map[string]string `json:"state,omitempty"`
}

type MissionSpec struct {
	Content string `json:"content,omitempty"`
	Placement GenericPlacementFields `json:"placement,omitempty"`
	StateCheck StateCheckFields `json:"statecheck"`
}

type GenericClusterReference struct {
	Name string `json:"name"`
}

type GenericPlacementFields struct {
	Clusters    []GenericClusterReference `json:"clusters,omitempty"`
	MatchLabels map[string]string         `json:"matchlabels,omitempty"`
}
```

Here a CRD called "Mission" is used to store the actual workload definition (Mission/MissionSpec/Content) and destination information (Mission/MissionSpec/Placement). The following figure illustrates the flow of CRD propagation. A CRD object enveloping workload definition is created in a cluster (cloud or edge), and it is picked up by the cloud core component which watches this CRD. This CRD is in turn propagated to the edge agents based on the destination criterias defined in *Placement*. Edge agent examines the CRD, unwrap the workload specification and insert into the edge cluster if location criterias are met. In the meantime, the cloud core in the current cluster will also pick up CRD and perform propagation in the same fashion.   

<img src="images/workload-assignment.png"
     width="65%" 
     align="center"/>

In the above figures, the mission (yellow envelope) is propagated through step 1 to 4 and eventually reaches the targeted edge cluster. This method allows workload to be distributed to multiple edge clusters based on placement rules customizable by user. 

### Workload Status Reporting
The hierarchy nature of edge structure demands cluster and workload status in each layer to be relayed upward to the top level control plane. Two components are added for the status reporting, as shown in green in the following figure:

<img src="images/status-update-component.png"
     width="50%" 
     align="center"/>

Based on the *Mission*, the status manager in EdgeClusterd periodically obtains the workload status from the subordinate cluster, and updates the *State* in the *Mission* object, which in turn is relayed to the upper level Cloud Core where the status is aggregated and updated into the etcd in that cluster's etcd. This action will trigger further updates following the same mechanism.

There are two kinds of status to be reported:

#### 1. Workload Status
The *Mission* CRD is used to carry workload information through edge cluster layers, and therefore workload information is stored as a part of the *[Mission/State]* definition called "State":

```golang
type Mission struct {
	...
	...
	State map[string]string `json:"state,omitempty"`
}
```
Each *Mission* can be deployed to multiple clusters, so the status is a collection of all workloads from the same *Mission*. The key to the *State* map is based on indivisual cluster (e.g. cluster name). 

#### 2. EdgeCluster Status
For edge cluster status, reporting is carried out in "heartbeat" fashion, similar to the node status update in "vanilla" K8s. Edge cluster status includes the health of the cluster and states of workloads running on it, defined as:

```golang
type EdgeClusterState struct {
	HealthStatus string `json:"healthstatus,omitempty"`
	SubEdgeClusterStates map[string]string `json:"subedgeclusterstates,omitempty"`
	Nodes []string `json:"nodes,omitempty"`
	EdgeNodes []string `json:"edgenodes,omitempty"`
	ReceivedMissions []string `json:"receivedmissions,omitempty"`
	ActiveMissions []string `json:"activemissions,omitempty"`
	LastHeartBeat metav1.Time `json:"lastheartbeat,omitempty"`
}
```
Similar to the workload status, edge cluster status is also relayed to upper layers trough the hierarchy.

### Attachment vs Self-Organizing

The tree structure of the Centaurus edge allows clusters on the edge to join as a sub-tree, and this approach is called "attachment", shown in the right side of the following figure. This usually applies to the scenarios where a cluster is already provisioned and running. By "attaching" to an existing edge tree, it will be able to take workloads together with other clusters in the same tree, hence forming a co-op topology.  

<img src="images/grouping-vs-attachment.png"
     width="65%" 
     align="center"/>

In addition to "attachment", a second option is to allow Centaurus edge framework to group a set of edge nodes into a cluster based on certain criteria. For example, as shown on the left of the above figure, users have a set of edge nodes (light blue, yellow, green and darker blue). These nodes are then selected (either by user's manual inputs or automatically chosen) to be converted and grouped together into an edge cluster. This approach has multiple benefits. Firstly, users are freed from managing cluster operation, and secondly, cluster node selection can be automated based on workload resource requirement and compute resource availability. This will be further investigated in later release cycles.

### Inter-cluster Communication
For some user scenarios, such as MEC, it is beneficial for edge clusters at different locations to communicate with each other without going through the cloud. The following figure is an example. Two pods in the same VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) 1 could be distributed into two different clusters. The goal is to allow communication between these two pods without routing through the cloud.  

<img src="images/inter-cluster-comm.png"
     width="65%" 
     align="center"/>

#### Scopes

The scope of the inter-cluster communication feature is:

  1. pods from the same VPC and in different physical clusters to communicate 
  2. pods from different VPCs in different physical clusters to communicate



#### Network Virtulization

The inter-cluster communication feature is to be built upon virtualizing K8s cluster networking space into VPCs and subnets. A VPC represents the network space (e.g. a CIDR range) for a certain organization or tenant, and contains one or many subnets which further divides the VPC into smaller spaces. Communication between pods in the same cluster is implemented in project such as [CentaurusInfra/mizar](https://github.com/CentaurusInfra/mizar). For the edge inter-cluster communication feature, the following assumptions are used:

- A VPC could span one or more edge-clusters
- A subnet within a VPC can only belong to one edge cluster
- An edge cluster could contain more than one subnets and VPCs

The following figure shows an example for VPC and subnet for a cascaded edge cluster system:

<img src="images/vpc-subnet.png"
     width="75%" 
     align="center"/>

In this example, each of the three edge clusters contains a few subnets from the same VPC. Note that the view of the above example is for *each* tenant. Subnets within a VPC do not have overlapped CIDR ranges but VPCs for different tenants can have overlapped CIDRs. 



#### Inter-cluster Communication Architecture

Given the distributed features of edge computing, the inter-cluster communication is designed without a centralized control plane. Each edge cluster works independently for its own networking while edge clusters work together in a "mesh" fashion for inter-cluster communication. The following figure illustrates an example of the architecture. There are three edge clusters cascaded in the same way as the figure above. Edge core



<img src="images/inter-cluster-comm-arch.png"
     width="85%" 
     align="center"/> 

In each edge cluster, there's a control plane and data plane. The control plane manages network objects (e.g. VPCs and subnets) and their workflows, and is responsible for programming the data plane components. The data plane, programmed by an agent on each node that takes info from the control plane, is responsible for actual network communication between pods. In the Mizar project, both control planes for such intra-cluster networking mechanism are implemented. Communication between pods within a subnet is managed by the "bouncer" component while cross-subnet traffic is managed by the "divider" component. Both bouncer and divider are [XDP](https://www.iovisor.org/technology/xdp) programs that are in charge of managing traffic with high performance and scalability. Each edge cluster runs a standalone network management system such as Mizar (control plane and data plane). Comparing with running Mizar for a single K8s cluster, one key difference is that in an edge cluster, the network control plane does not always contain the entire range of network objects between VPC can span beyond a single cluster. Each network control plane simply works with the network objects in its sight from the cluster's etcd. 

When the target pod is located in a different edge cluster from the source pod, the network traffic is to be routed between clusters through public network. For this purpose a gateway component is introduced. Each edge cluster with public IP runs and exposes the gateway. All gateways are connected through a point-2-point mesh mechanism. Each gateway is responsible of routing internal pod to pod traffic to its target cluster's gateway and vice versa. The internal traffic comes from edge cluster networking data plane components such as the divider. Divider keeps a list of subnets for its clusters. When the target subnet falls out of the list, traffic is redirected to the gateway. Gateway maintains a map of VPC/Subnet to gateway endpoints. Using this map, gateway packages packets with necessary security encapsulation and sends them through public network to the target gateway. On the receiving end, the other gateway validates, extracts packet, and then sends it to the network data plane component such as a divider for further routing. To reduce the number of "hops", within each cluster optimization such as "direct path" from Mizar could be used to allow packet to be sent to gateway directly after the first packet.  

##### Gateway Endpoint Synchronization

The endpoint information on each gateway is maintained in a distributed fashion. When a new VPC or subnet is created, other clusters that own the same VPC need to be notified to update their gateway map such that communication between those subnets could be routed. The following figure is an example.
